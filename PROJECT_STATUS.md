## Current Debugging Focus

### Queue Generation System Challenges
- 🔍 Investigating inconsistent queue initialization
- 🐛 Debugging section generation process
- 🚧 Identifying potential bottlenecks in OpenAI and DALL-E interactions

### Specific Areas of Investigation
1. **Queue Initialization**
   - Verify complete queue item creation
   - Check status tracking mechanism
   - Ensure proper error handling

2. **Section Generation**
   - Monitor OpenAI content generation reliability
   - Track DALL-E image generation success rate
   - Implement more robust retry mechanisms

3. **Database Interactions**
   - Review transaction management
   - Verify status updates for queue items
   - Ensure data consistency across tables

### Immediate Action Items
- [ ] Enhance logging in queue generation process
- [ ] Create more granular error tracking
- [ ] Implement comprehensive monitoring scripts
- [ ] Review and optimize API interaction timeouts

### Potential Performance Improvements
- Implement exponential backoff for API retries
- Add more detailed error context
- Create a comprehensive monitoring dashboard

## Upcoming Tasks
1. Monitoring and Optimization
   - Add queue performance monitoring
   - Implement queue cleanup for stale items
   - Add max attempts handling

2. Type System Improvements
   - Add explicit types for queue statuses
   - Improve type safety across the application

3. Error Handling
   - Add more detailed error reporting
   - Implement better retry strategies

## Known Issues
- None currently reported

## Next Steps
1. Monitor queue system performance in production
2. Gather metrics on generation success rates
3. Implement suggested improvements after stability is confirmed
